Subject Title
Critical Thinking

Subject Description
This course introduces students to foundations of critical thinking. Students will discover and apply a framework of mental skills and digital resources designed to (a) improve the quality of their reasoning and communication and (b) facilitate wise decisions in personal, work, and educational contexts. They will explore pervasive mental errors such as cognitive biases and practice reflecting on and regulating their own thinking (i.e., metacognition), discover principles of logic needed to recognize and evaluate arguments, and develop their media and information literacy to identify trustworthy and appropriate sources. Students will integrate and apply their emerging critical thinking skills through the rigorous evaluation of digital communications.

Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this subject the student will be able to:

1. Apply intellectual standards for critical thinking to improve reasoning and communication.
 
2. Discuss mental processes, such as cognitive biases and fallacious modes of reasoning, that can serve as barriers to effective judgment and decision-making.
 
3. Recognize types of arguments and non-arguments in digital communications.
 
4. Evaluate arguments to establish whether it would be reasonable to accept their conclusions.
 
5. Examine contextual factors, such as publication venue and author credentials, experience, and affiliations, that may impact the trustworthiness of communications.
 
6. Compile high-quality sources of information through effective internet search and lateral reading practices.
