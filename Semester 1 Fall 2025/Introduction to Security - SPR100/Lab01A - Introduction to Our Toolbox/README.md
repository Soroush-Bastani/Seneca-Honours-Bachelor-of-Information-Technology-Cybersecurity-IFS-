## Reflection
The first issue I encountered was that I couldn't install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win, as instructed in the Pre-lab. I then tried downloading it through Seneca's MyApps, but ran into additional problems. To avoid further delays, I switched to using my laptop instead.

Since Git was previously installed on my laptop, I faced another issue when trying to push the content to the correct repository. To resolve this, I created a new user account on the laptop and was able to complete the assignment successfully.

Lastly, because Git doesn't allow committing empty folders, I added some sample files to the code, documents, and images folders to ensure they were included in the repository.
