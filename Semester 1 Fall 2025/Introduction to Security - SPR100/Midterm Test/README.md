## Question Policy During the Test

No question related to the test tasks will be answered. For example, the following questions **will not** be answered during the test:

- “Am I supposed to do XXXXX in the task YYY?”
- “How do I copy XXXXX in VM? How do I move file into/out of the VM?”
- “Is it OK if I submit this XXXXX to the answer sheet YYYY?”
- “I am having this error XXXX when I execute the script YYYY, what should I do?”
- “Can you confirm XXXX is what I am supposed to do/submit for the Task YYYY?”

Remember: this is a **test**, not a lab session where you can ask for help. Make your own best judgment on what to do.

If you meet technical issues during the test caused by your security lab computer, no help will be provided. Please raise your hand and ask to change to another computer.
