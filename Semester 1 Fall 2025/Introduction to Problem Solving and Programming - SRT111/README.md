Subject Title
Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming

Subject Description
This course is an introduction to computational problem solving and programming in python language. The course provides students with an opportunity to learn how to think like a computer scientist to solve the complex problems by breaking them down and writing procedural algorithms. The course provides an overview of python language constructs and gives a hands-on experience to write codes in python language. The course is designed for students with no prior exposure to computer programming. This course will enable them to learn and think computationally and write programs to solve useful problems.

Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this subject the student will be able to:

Solve a computational problem by representing its steps in flow charts and pseudocode to simplify a complex problem.
Use procedural programing constructs to translate pseudocode into a computer program.
Debug a program to find and correct programming mistakes.
Demonstrate the use of abstract data types to program real world problems.
Use basic Object-Oriented concepts to implement abstraction.
Create programs to solve problems of medium complexity.
